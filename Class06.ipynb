        "Apache Airflow is a powerful orchestration tool for automating ETL pipelines in cloud environments, coordinating the extraction, transformation, and loading of data while ensuring tasks are executed in the correct sequence. By using Python, Pandas, and Airflow’s operators and providers, data engineers can efficiently manage workflows, monitor progress, handle errors, and integrate with services like AWS, GCP, and Azure. Following best practices—such as keeping tasks atomic, using templates, and enabling retries—allows the creation of robust, scalable, and reliable pipelines, making Airflow an essential tool for modern data-driven organizations."
